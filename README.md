# Voluntouring

Voluntouring is a digital platform that unites people who are passionate about other languages ​​and cultures in a fun way.

Through the platform, anyone can register as a guide, set up a tourist itinerary focusing on different categories of their interest, such as history, arts, music, sports, among others, and take a group of tourists to have fun with then at events of these categories.

The tourist, in turn, has the opportunity to experience the visited city in a different way from those offered by the traditional city tours, since they will have the chance to know the city from the point of view of a local citizen.
